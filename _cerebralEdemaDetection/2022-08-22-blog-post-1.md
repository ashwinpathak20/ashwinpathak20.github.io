# 1. CT Head Interpretation <a name="ctHeadInterpretation"></a>

Computed tomography (CT) scanning involves the use of X-rays to take cross-sectional images of the body.

The extent to which a material can be penetrated by an X-ray beam is described in terms of an attenuation coefficient which assesses how much a beam is weakened by passing through a voxel of tissue (voxel = volumetric pixel).
These values are frequently expressed as Hounsfield units (HU).

## Windowing

Windowing (also known as grey-level mapping) is the process of changing the location and width of the available greyscale in order to optimise discrimination between tissues.

# 2. Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection by 3D Voxel Segmentation on Brain CT Images <a name="intracranialHemorrhage"></a>

## Problem Statement

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a vital disease which occurs due ot leakage or rupture of blood vessels within the brain tissues.

This paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting the hemmorhage regions from brain CT images using image segmentation techniques.

## Related Work

Most of the related works use very simple segmentation algorithms such as clustering and thresholding so that these methods may perform well on standard images but cannot deal with complex situations such as the hemorrhage region overlaps with the brain tissues or the edge of hemorrhage is not discriminative enough. 

Also, these methods only deal with 2-dimensional images.

## Method

1. Use FCM to cluster pixels for the intracranial region.
2. Use Otsu's adaptive thresholding to further segment the hemorrhagic region.
3. Series of 2D images are reconstructed into 3D spaces by using MITK. Only the detected regions need to be reconstructed which saves big amount of time.
4. For refined segmentation, Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) approach is used as part of supervoxel algorithm.
5. Then, to further refine segmentation, graph cuts are used.

## Dataset

Experiments are carried out on a Brain CT database, which
consists of CT images of 20 patients who were suffering with
ICH. For each patient, there are 250 to 350 2D CT images
according to different head size of each patient. This database
is collected from Department of Neurosurgery, CPLA No. 98
Hospital, Huzhou, China. The CT images are acquired from
CT scanners manufactured by General Electric (GE) medical
systems. Each CT image is stored in DICOM file format, with
a size of 512×512 and spatial resolution of 0.468×0.468mm.
Based on the agreements of patients, part of this database is
online upon requests.

## Metrics Used
1. True Positive Fraction (TPF)
2. False Fraction (FF)
3. Segmentation Error (SE)


# 3. Deep Learning for Hemorrhagic Lesion Detection and Segmentation on Brain CT Images <a name="hemorrhagicLesion"></a>

## Problem Statement
Stroke is a disease caused by the decrease of blood flow to the brain. A stroke
occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly
interrupted (ischemic stroke) or when a blood vessel in the brain
bursts and spills blood into the spaces surrounding brain cells
(hemorrhage stroke). 

This paper proposes a U-Net based deep learning framework to automatically detect and segment hemorrhage strokes in CT brain images.

## Related Work

Few works use 3D CNN for segmentation. However, due to the high
computational cost and GPU memory consumption, the depth
of the 3D network is limited compared to that of a 2D network.
This makes the 3D network impractical in stroke diagnosis.
Besides, due the high complexity of 3D networks, it is even more
difficult to get an adjustable parameter for the ideal model to get
the best performance. 

There is also less work done on hemorrhage stroke semantic segmentation and no semantic segmentation approach has shown competitive performance compared with human experts.

## Method

1. Input :  Instead of using the original CT
   images, this paper concatenates the flipped image with the
   original CT slice as input of the network, which validate
   the effective of symmetric structure in contrast enhancement. Aside from data argumentation, data balance was
   also discussed in the proposed model.
2. Structure of the model: Based on the most state-of-the-art
    UNet model, various kinds of modified architectures with
    different layers, batch normalization, dilation rates and
    pre-train models were compared and evaluated, which
    provide a solution on how to increase the respective filed
    and preserves more information of lesion characteristic
3. Training process: To reduce the effect of the normal
   area in the brain image, the conditional generative adversarial nets (GAN) were modified by using UNet as a
   generator. Then the discriminator can be used to exploit
   higher-order inconsistencies in the samples synthesized
   by the generator. Patch training and the activation layer
   of LeakyReLu are used in the training process to improve
   the performance in the small lesion part of the image.

## Dataset

1. Dataset1: A single comprehensive stroke center dataset is
   collected, which includes the brain CT images of 190 patients
   presenting acute stroke symptoms to the emergency department
   (58 with hemorrhage, 101 normal). Strokes occur in different
   locations, with large differences in shape, size, contrast, and unclear boundaries compared with normal parts of the brain across
   different patients. Interpreting a CT image for hemorrhagic
   stroke requires thorough evaluation, especially to identify the
   small area of hemorrhage with low contrast from normal brain
   tissue. For lesions that do not have distinguished
   edges or contrast with normal parts, it is very difficult to confirm
   even by an expert. Based on that, stroke neurologists divided
   the dataset into two different subsets: one containing subjects with large lesions that are easily diagnosed and one containing
   subjects with small lesions that are hard to diagnose. The former had 71 images and the latter had 49
   images. Manual segmentation of the hemorrhage CT scans was
   used as the ground truth to evaluate different UNet structures.
2. Dataset2: A benchmark dataset, which includes 36 scans for patients diagnosed
   with intracranial hemorrhage with the following types: Intraventricular, Intraparenchymal, Subarachnoid, Epidural and Subdural. Each CT scan for each patient includes about 30 slices with 5
   mm slice-thickness. The mean and std of patients’ age were 27.8
   and 19.5, respectively. 46 of the patients were males and 36 of
   them were females. Each slice of the non-contrast CT scans was
   examined by two radiologists who recorded hemorrhage types
   if hemorrhage occurred or if a fracture occurred.

1. Location Accuracy (LA)
2. Dice similarity coefficient (DSC)
3. Intersection over Union (IoU)
4. Precision and Recall

# 4. Autoencoders for unsupervised anomaly segmentation in brain MR images: A comparative study <a name="AEUAD"></a>

## Problem Statement

Supervised deep learning have few disadvantages like their training calls for large and diverse annotated datasets which are scarce and costly to obtain.
Also, the resulting models are limited to the discovery of lesions which are similar to those in the training data.

The underlying idea thereby is to model the distribution of
healthy anatomy of the human brain with the help of deep (generative) representation learning. Once trained, anomalies can be
detected as outliers from the modeled, normative distribution.
AEs and their generative
siblings have emerged as a popular framework to achieve this by essentially learning to compress and reconstruct MR data of healthy anatomy. The respective methods can essentially be divided into two categories: 

1. Reconstruction-based approaches compute a pixel-wise discrepancy between input samples and their feed-forward reconstructions to determine anomalous lesions directly in image-space
2. Restoration-based methods try to alter an input image by moving along the latent manifold
until a normal counterpart to the input sample is found, which
in turn is used again to detect lesions from the pixel-wise discrepancy of the input data and its healthy restoration. 

## Related Work

All of the UAD based methods report promising performances. However, results
can hardly be compared and drawing general conclusions on their
strengths & weaknesses is barely possible. This is hindered by
the following issues:
1. most of the works rely on very different
datasets with barely overlapping characteristics for their evaluation
2. are evaluated against different pathologies
3. operate on different resolutions 
4. utilize different model architectures with varying model complexity. 

The intent of this work is to
establish comparability among a broad selection of recent methods by utilizing a single network architecture,
a single resolution and the same dataset(s).

# 6. Intensity population based unsupervised hemorrhage segmentation from brain CT images <a name="IntensityPopulation"></a>

## Problem Statement

This paper suggests a lightweight and a sufficiently accurate method for detection of hemorrhage. 

## Related Work

Hemorrhage finding is mostly done by locating threshold on the
histogram. This is done automatically through machines artificial
intelligence using different algorithms like fuzzy C-means, Hopfield neural network, maximum entropy, fuzzy maximal likelihood estimation,
probabilistic neural network, genetic algorithm. 

To detect hemorrhage few more approaches to knowledge based detection,
histogram-based K-means clustering, wavelet-based texture analysis are also proposed in different works.

Unsupervised clustering and backtracking tree search method are also reported in some
papers. 


Deep learning methods are also in used for segmentation.
      Most of them are supervised techniques which require a large
      number of data. This requirement itself is a disadvantage of these
      methods. Different deep learning techniques are outperformed by the
      traditional k-means method used in an unsupervised system which
      involves a limited number of data.

## Method

1. HU based windowing is done.
2. Skull stripping is followed using slopes and thresholds.
3. Then brain segmentation is done by finding the largest connected component.
4. Background removing is then done using threshold from intensity population.
5. Further hemorrhage is segmented using population histogram. This method uses deviation between actual and expected Population.
6. In order to further refine results, localtion finalization is also done on the dataset level.

## Dataset

Datasets of multi-slice brain CT images are taken for hemorrhage detection. Images are scanned by a 64 slice CT scanner
with slice thickness 5 mm. The original DICOM (Digital Imaging

# 7. Multi-view fusion segmentation for brain glioma on CT images <a name="mvfusionSegmentation"></a>

## Problem Statement

2D CNN-based methods address image sequences by segmenting the different slice
images separately. In contrast, 3D CNN-based methods segment the entire image sequence as a whole. Because of the
resulting drop in spatial information, 2D CNN-based methods generally have lower performance than 3D-based methods. However, 3D-based methods require a more complex
network structure and are more challenging to train.

To address the above problems, the paper proposes an encoder decoder brain tumor segmentation framework with multiview fusion. 

## Related Work

There are a lot of traditional ways of doing segmentation. Although traditional methods have made great achievements in segmenting brain tumors, there remain several drawbacks. The segmentation performances of the
above methods rely heavily on hand-crafted features,
meaning that weak features may cause failures in subsequent processes. Furthermore, the manual selection of
features is time-consuming and subjective, which means
that it is difficult to improve the performance of these
approaches.

Hence, paper propose multi-view fusion using deep neural networks.

## Method

1. Data is preprocessed using windowing and other basic steps.
2. Encoder-decoder framework is used where the input is the multi-view image including the previous, current and following image is used. 
3. More details are clearly mentioned in the paper (Supervised technique).

## Dataset

The data used in the experiments came from a total of 225
patients with pathologically proven glioma cancer who were
treated with postoperative radiotherapy from February 2016
to April 2019 at the Department of Radiation Oncology of
West China Hospital, Sichuan University.

## Metrics used

2. True positive volume fraction (TPVF)
3. Positive predictive value (PPV)

# 8. Accelerating Prediction of Malignant Cerebral Edema After Ischemic Stroke with Automated Image Analysis and Explainable Neural Networks <a name="cerebralEdemaPrediction"></a>

## Problem Statement

Cerebral edema develops in the hours to days after acute
ischemic stroke and may result in midline shift and cerebral herniation. Te volume of cerebrospinal fuid (CSF) relative to
total cranial volume, termed intracranial reserve, is
emerging as a useful biomarker, with lower reserve on
baseline imaging increasing the risk for subsequent
edema-related decompensation. 

Paper proposes a pilot study evaluating the impact of
two significant innovations to the imaging-based prediction algorithm: the first is to incorporate the hemispheric
CSF ratio (i.e., the ratio of CSF volumes between the two
hemispheres), not just total CSF displacement; the
second is to employ neural networks that can integrate
serial clinical and imaging features in complex, dynamic,
and nonlinear ways to enhance prediction beyond what
is capable by traditional regression models.

## Method

1. Imaging analysis is done first and CSF ratio is calculated by hemisphere.
2. Fully-connected neural network and LSTMs were used for prediction.

## Dataset

Patients enrolled in an international prospective inpatient stroke cohort (the Genetics of Neurological Instability after Ischemic Stroke [GENISIS]) study between
2008 and 2017 were retrospectively evaluated for eligibility. All participants presented within 6  h of stroke
onset. They selected those with baseline CT within 12 h of
onset and follow-up CT within 48 h from three sites. At
two sites, it was standard protocol to obtain repeat CT
at 24  h after thrombolytic and/or endovascular therapies. At the third, it was performed at the stroke physician’s discretion and for any deterioration or concerns for
neurological complications. They excluded participants if
onset time was unknown, if the baseline CT scan already
showed well-developed infarction (suggesting that the
time of stroke onset was likely earlier than annotated;
other acute stroke-related hypodensity was acceptable), if
the stroke was located in the brainstem or cerebellum, or
if the final discharge diagnosis was not stroke.
NIHSS scores were obtained at baseline (within 6 h of
stroke onset or last time known to be well) and at 24 h.
Serum glucose and blood pressure were obtained on
presentation. All participants provided informed consent. Tey were observed prospectively for neurological
deterioration or death during hospital admission. Surgery
(DHC) was considered in cases of clinical deterioration
with midline shift and not preemptively prior to deterioration. Our primary end point was the development
of malignant edema leading to either DHC and/or death
in the presence of midline shift of 5 mm or greater.
This retrospective imaging sub-study was approved by the
coordinating site’s institutional review board.

# 9. Automated medical image segmentation techniques <a name="medicalImageSegmentation"></a>

The paper talks about MRI and CT medical images.

MR acquisition takes considerably longer time as compared to CT and
in case of MR it is more difficult to obtain uniform image quality. CT scans are particularly used in imaging and the diagnosis of following body parts: brain, liver, chest, abdomen and pelvis, spine and also for CT based angiography.

In case of brain imaging, CT scans are typically used to detect: bleeding, brain damage and skull fracture in patients with head injuries; bleeding caused by a ruptured or leaking aneurysm in a patient with a sudden severe headache, blood clot or bleeding within the brain shortly after a patient exhibits symptoms of a stroke, brain tumors, cyst, diseases related to malformations of the skull, enlarged brain cavities (ventricles).

CT scanning is fast and simple, provides more detailed information on head injuries, and stroke; can reveal internal injuries and bleeding quick enough to help save lives in emergency cases.

# 10. Application of Machine Learning to Automated Analysis of Cerebral Edema in Large Cohorts of Ischemic Stroke Patients <a name="ApplicationOfML"></a>

The paper presents results of their preliminary processing pipeline that was able to efficiently extract CSF volumetrics from an initial cohort of 155 subjects enrolled in a prospective longitudinal stroke study.

The paper demonstrated that the volume of CSF displaced up to the time of maximal edema closely correlated with extent of midline shift.

The image processing pipeline to analyze CSF volumes :

![Figure](https://www.frontiersin.org/files/Articles/393383/fneur-09-00687-HTML/image_m/fneur-09-00687-g001.jpg)

The steps outlined are :
1. Subjects and Data collection
2. DICOM conversion
   1. using dcm2niix software
3. Image Selection
4. Brain extraction and Perimeter Registration
   1. Skull stripping - k means clustering
   2. Registration - using Advanced Normalized Toolkit (ANTS)
5. CSF segmentation
   1. Use random forest machine learning - Cited in the paper.
   2. Results refined using an active contour method and cleaned using a manually drawn mask of the infract hypodensity.
6. Volumetric Analyses
   1. The number of pixels in each compartment (intracranial compartment, CSF, infarct) is extracted from each image mask. This is then converted into volume using the pixel dimensions in the image header.

# 11. Quantitative Serial CT Imaging-Derived Features Improve Prediction of Malignant Cerebral Edema after Ischemic Stroke <a name="ImageDerivedFeatures"></a>

The paper aims to develop a multivariable machine learning model for predicting malignant cerebral edema
using a combination of clinical and quantitative imaging
variables extracted from CTs at baseline and 24-h.

The pipeline for imaging analysis is given in the paper. This included first extraction of the intracranial
supratentorial space using k-means clustering for skull
removal followed by registration of each baseline image
to atlas templates for removal of infratentorial and noncranial structures. Te follow-up images were then coregistered to the baseline for each participant to ensure
similar brain volumes were analyzed. These cranial
regions then underwent automated segmentation into
CSF and brain compartments. If more than one scan
was performed at a time point (e.g., normal axial brain
and thin slices), they selected scans with 3–5-mm slice
thickness, for consistency. The intracranial reserve was
calculated as the proportion of cranial volume comprised
by CSF. Percent change in CSF volume from baseline to 24-h was calculated as ∆CSF. Midline shift was
measured manually by a single trained investigator at the
level of the septum pellucidum. Infarct-related hypodensity was manually outlined slice-by-slice to provide lesion
volume (a combination of infarct and edema).

Te dataset was complete except for a few missing
data points: for NIHSS and glucose. Values were
imputed for each missing feature using the three closest
data points, using the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm. All features were then standardized to improve
stability of model training. Te dataset was partitioned
into ten folds, and tenfold cross-validation was employed
to train and internally validate each model. 

They applied logistic regression to provide probabilistic binary outputs using a one-layer neural network
with softmax activation, implemented within the Keras
machine-learning platform.

AUPRC is used as a metric.
