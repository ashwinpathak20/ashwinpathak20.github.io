# CT Head Interpretation

Computed tomography (CT) scanning involves the use of X-rays to take cross-sectional images of the body.

The extent to which a material can be penetrated by an X-ray beam is described in terms of an attenuation coefficient which assesses how much a beam is weakened by passing through a voxel of tissue (voxel = volumetric pixel).
These values are frequently expressed as Hounsfield units (HU).

## Windowing

Windowing (also known as grey-level mapping) is the process of changing the location and width of the available greyscale in order to optimise discrimination between tissues.
