# 1. CT Head Interpretation <a name="ctHeadInterpretation"></a>

Computed tomography (CT) scanning involves the use of X-rays to take cross-sectional images of the body.

The extent to which a material can be penetrated by an X-ray beam is described in terms of an attenuation coefficient which assesses how much a beam is weakened by passing through a voxel of tissue (voxel = volumetric pixel).
These values are frequently expressed as Hounsfield units (HU).

## Windowing

Windowing (also known as grey-level mapping) is the process of changing the location and width of the available greyscale in order to optimise discrimination between tissues.

# 2. Intracranial Hemorrhage Detection by 3D Voxel Segmentation on Brain CT Images <a name="intracranialHemorrhage"></a>

## Problem Statement

Intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) is a vital disease which occurs due ot leakage or rupture of blood vessels within the brain tissues.

This paper addresses the problem of automatically detecting the hemmorhage regions from brain CT images using image segmentation techniques.

## Related Work

Most of the related works use very simple segmentation algorithms such as clustering and thresholding so that these methods may perform well on standard images but cannot deal with complex situations such as the hemorrhage region overlaps with the brain tissues or the edge of hemorrhage is not discriminative enough. 

Also, these methods only deal with 2-dimensional images.

## Method

1. Use FCM to cluster pixels for the intracranial region.
2. Use Otsu's adaptive thresholding to further segment the hemorrhagic region.
3. Series of 2D images are reconstructed into 3D spaces by using MITK. Only the detected regions need to be reconstructed which saves big amount of time.
4. For refined segmentation, Simple Linear Iterative Clustering (SLIC) approach is used as part of supervoxel algorithm.
5. Then, to further refine segmentation, graph cuts are used.

## Dataset

Experiments are carried out on a Brain CT database, which
consists of CT images of 20 patients who were suffering with
ICH. For each patient, there are 250 to 350 2D CT images
according to different head size of each patient. This database
is collected from Department of Neurosurgery, CPLA No. 98
Hospital, Huzhou, China. The CT images are acquired from
CT scanners manufactured by General Electric (GE) medical
systems. Each CT image is stored in DICOM file format, with
a size of 512×512 and spatial resolution of 0.468×0.468mm.
Based on the agreements of patients, part of this database is
online upon requests.

## Metrics Used
1. True Positive Fraction (TPF)
2. False Fraction (FF)
3. Segmentation Error (SE)


# 3. Deep Learning for Hemorrhagic Lesion Detection and Segmentation on Brain CT Images <a name="hemorrhagicLesion"></a>

## Problem Statement
Stroke is a disease caused by the decrease of blood flow to the brain. A stroke
occurs when the blood supply to part of the brain is suddenly
interrupted (ischemic stroke) or when a blood vessel in the brain
bursts and spills blood into the spaces surrounding brain cells
(hemorrhage stroke). 

This paper proposes a U-Net based deep learning framework to automatically detect and segment hemorrhage strokes in CT brain images.

## Related Work

Few works use 3D CNN for segmentation. However, due to the high
computational cost and GPU memory consumption, the depth
of the 3D network is limited compared to that of a 2D network.
This makes the 3D network impractical in stroke diagnosis.
Besides, due the high complexity of 3D networks, it is even more
difficult to get an adjustable parameter for the ideal model to get
the best performance. 

There is also less work done on hemorrhage stroke semantic segmentation and no semantic segmentation approach has shown competitive performance compared with human experts.

## Method
1. Input :  Instead of using the original CT
   images, this paper concatenates the flipped image with the
   original CT slice as input of the network, which validate
   the effective of symmetric structure in contrast enhancement. Aside from data argumentation, data balance was
   also discussed in the proposed model.
2. Structure of the model: Based on the most state-of-the-art
    UNet model, various kinds of modified architectures with
    different layers, batch normalization, dilation rates and
    pre-train models were compared and evaluated, which
    provide a solution on how to increase the respective filed
    and preserves more information of lesion characteristic
3. Training process: To reduce the effect of the normal
   area in the brain image, the conditional generative adversarial nets (GAN) were modified by using UNet as a
   generator. Then the discriminator can be used to exploit
   higher-order inconsistencies in the samples synthesized
   by the generator. Patch training and the activation layer
   of LeakyReLu are used in the training process to improve
   the performance in the small lesion part of the image.

## Dataset

1. Dataset1: A single comprehensive stroke center dataset is
   collected, which includes the brain CT images of 190 patients
   presenting acute stroke symptoms to the emergency department
   (58 with hemorrhage, 101 normal). Strokes occur in different
   locations, with large differences in shape, size, contrast, and unclear boundaries compared with normal parts of the brain across
   different patients. Interpreting a CT image for hemorrhagic
   stroke requires thorough evaluation, especially to identify the
   small area of hemorrhage with low contrast from normal brain
   tissue. For lesions that do not have distinguished
   edges or contrast with normal parts, it is very difficult to confirm
   even by an expert. Based on that, stroke neurologists divided
   the dataset into two different subsets: one containing subjects with large lesions that are easily diagnosed and one containing
   subjects with small lesions that are hard to diagnose. The former had 71 images and the latter had 49
   images. Manual segmentation of the hemorrhage CT scans was
   used as the ground truth to evaluate different UNet structures.
2. Dataset2: A benchmark dataset, which includes 36 scans for patients diagnosed
   with intracranial hemorrhage with the following types: Intraventricular, Intraparenchymal, Subarachnoid, Epidural and Subdural. Each CT scan for each patient includes about 30 slices with 5
   mm slice-thickness. The mean and std of patients’ age were 27.8
   and 19.5, respectively. 46 of the patients were males and 36 of
   them were females. Each slice of the non-contrast CT scans was
   examined by two radiologists who recorded hemorrhage types
   if hemorrhage occurred or if a fracture occurred.
