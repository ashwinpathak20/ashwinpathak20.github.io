## Introduction

One of the tasks humans efficiently do is make sense of the visual information around us. However, we communicate our understanding of the visual information using natural language. Vision and Language usually go hand-in-hand for a lot of tasks we perform daily and thus it is important for machines to be able to do so as well. Visual Question Answering, introduced in [1], is one such task where the problem is to select one of many possible answers given an image and a question associated with the image. See figure 1 for an example. The VQA v2 [2] dataset has 82,783 training images which lead to 443,757 questions in total. Each question was answered by 10 humans generating a total of 4,437,570 answers.  There has been a lot of interest in multi-modal research, especially on vision and language modalities recently. CLIP [3] accelerated this research by releasing a large self-supervised trained model on a huge corpus of image, text pairs. Thanks to the easy access to the trained model, it has been used for various vision and language tasks such as zero-shot image classification [3], zero-shot text-to-image generation [4] and many others [5, 6]. We propose to leverage CLIP pre-trained embedding space to solve the VQA task.

## Problem definition

Giving machines the ability to understand and communicate the understanding through question answering is an important and impactful task with a lot of social benefits like helping visually impaired humans [7]. However, it is often difficult and expensive to train huge models on large datasets. We propose to leverage the already available pre-trained vision-and-language CLIP model for the VQA task efficiently.

## Methods

**Supervised section**: CLIP has a visual encoder and a text encoder trained to align the vision and text embeddings when the inputs are aligned (see figure 2). We plan on adding a question-answer encoder that transforms the text embeddings from the question and the correct answer to align well with the image embedding (figure 3).

**Unsupervised section**: While inference, the above approach would require encoding all possible answers to select the one which aligns the most. However, this is inefficient as the answers can be filtered out based on the question type. For example, the answer to “What color is …?” can never be “apple”. Thus if we are able to form clusters of answer types, we can use these clusters to filter out potential answers and reduce the computation cost while inference.

## Data Preprocessing
To enable zero-shot transfer we generate question-answer pairs using top 1000 answers from VQA train split, we use the top 1000 most frequent answers to generate question-answer pairs. For each question-answer pair we generate a corresponding text prompt by using fixed question  separator token ("Q:", "Question:", etc) and answer separator token ("A:", "Answer:", etc), for example "Question: What color is ....? Answer: apple".
Here's the preprocessing we perform for image input to CLIP:
1. Resize the input image to length of shortest edge
2. Center crop the image to 224x224
3. Normalize the image
To save training and evaluationg time for our model we precompute the image features for the static VQA dataset and save it on disk.


## Results and Discussion

### Unsupervised
To establish baselines to compare with our approach we start with experiments on zero-shot transfer of CLIP for VQA.

### Zero-Shot VQA using CLIP
In this approach we use pretrained CLIP text and image encoders to predict answer for the target question. To enable zero-shot transfer we generate question-answer pairs using top 1000 answers from VQA train split, we use the top 1000 most frequent answers to generate question-answer pairs. For each question-answer pair we generate a corresponding text prompt by using fixed question  separator token ("Q:", "Question:", etc) and answer separator token ("A:", "Answer:", etc), for example "Question: What color is ....? Answer: apple". Each question-answer prompt along with the image is passed through CLIP text and visual encoder to generate a similarity score, we then choose answer from the question-answer prompt with maximum similarity score as predicted answer. In these experiments, we focus on engineering the best prompt for zero-shot transfer of CLIP for VQA.

| Prompt                                       | other | number | yes/no |
| -------------------------------------------- | --- | --- | --- |
|< question > + " " + < answer > (Top 1000)                   |  7.01 |  0.06  |  0.07  |
|< question > + " " + < answer > (Top 3000)                   |  4.50 |  0.04  |  0.04  |
|Question: < question > + " " + Answer: < answer > (Top 1000) |  6.65 |  0.07  |  0.06  |

<p align="center">(1.) CLIP Zero-Shot transfer on VQA sampled val. Accuracy for per question type</p>

Table 1. shows the results of zero-shot transfer of CLIP on VQA val split. First, we use a simple prompt that just appends <question> with a possible <answer> using space (" ") separator token. This prompt achieves 7.01% accuracy on questions of other category, 0.06% accuracy on questions which have number answer and 0.07% accuracy on yes/no questions (row 1). Next, we use the same prompt as row 1 but instead increase the set of candidate answers to top 3000 answers. We find that increasing the candidate answer search space leads to 2.51% worse accuracy on questions from other category, 0.03% worse accuracy on questions from yes/no category and 0.02% worse accuracy on questions from number category (row 1 vs 2). Finally, we use a prompt with separate question and answer separator. Following prompt uses "Question: " separator token followed by <question> and "Answer: " separator token followed by <answer> which are both appended using a space token (" "). This prompt performs 0.35% worse on questions from other category, 0.01% worse on questions from yes/no category and 0.01% better on questions from number category compared to a simple prompt (row 1 vs 3). 

Across our prompt engineering experiments we don't find significant improvements over our simple prompt baseline implying that prompt engineering is not enough to achieve good results on VQA. We hypothesize that the poor performance is due to large pool of candidates used for zero-shot predictions, as we naively choose top-k candidates based on answer frequency there are noisy targets in the our pool of answers which leads to inaccurate predictions. We inspect for such occurences manually and show a few examples in the analysis section. As part of future work we would like to investigate how we can select relevant answers at a high-level based on just question input. For example, for a question like "What color is the cat?" answer candidates that answer yes/no questions should be filtered out.


### Supervised

In order to improve over our unsupervised baselines we implement 2 supervised baselines. We propose a vanilla N-way classification baseline that uses frozen CLIP represntations to establish a upper bound for comparison of our Question-Answer embedding alignment model.

### Question-Answer embedding alignment model

To improve our zero-shot CLIP baseline we propose a Question-Answer embedding alginment approach. In this approach, we train a 2-layer MLP which takes frozen CLIP representations for Question text and Answer text as input and fuses them into a single Question-Answer canidadate representation. We use this joint learned representation as a query representation for the frozen CLIP image representation. Finally, we concatenate joint Question-Answer embedding and Image embedding and pass them through a linear layer that learns similarity of these representations. 

We sample the batches for training similar to contrastive style training where we sample 1 positive example and n-1 negative examples for each question. Sampling batches in this form allows our model to learn to map embeddings for relevant answers closer in embedding space and push the embedding that are not relevant far apart. We experiment across different hyper-parameter value for choosing n-1 negative samples as shown in the table.

| Num candidates | Overall accuracy |
| -------------- | --- |
| 5  |  24.69 |
| 10 |  4.50 |

<p align="center">(2.) Question-Answer alignment model performance on VQA sampled val</p>

Table 2. shows the results of Question-Answer alignment model on VQA sampled val split. We ablate on different values of num candidates we select for our approach. Using 5 candidates for negative sampling we acheive 24.69% accuracy on the evaluation split which is xx% better when compared to using 10 candidates. We observe a drastic drop in performance as we scale the number of candidates used for negative samples. This is likely due to high class imbalance when training the model. This can be mitigated by finding the right class balance or by using appropriate loss re-weighting when updating the model. We leave investigating solutions to this issue as future work.


### N-way classification using CLIP representations

As a simple upper-bound we set up a vanilla N-way classification baseline using frozen CLIP representations. We use a simple learnable 2-layer MLP that takes Image and Text CLIP embeddings as input and learns to predict answer using N-way classification head. This baseline leverages rich CLIP representations and learns a simple mapper that can map question and an image to answer.

| Method | Overall accuracy |
| -------------- | --- |
| Zero-shot (unsupervised)  |  2.85 |
| Question-Answer alignment (supervised) |  24.69 |
| N-way classification  (supervised) |  49.27 |

<p align="center">(3.) Comparison of performance of proposed approaches on VQA sampled val</p>

Table. 3 shows comparison of proposed approaches on VQA sampled val dataset. Our zero-shot baseline (row 1) achieves 2.85% val accuracy overall which is 46.42% worse when compared to N-way classification baseline (row 3). Next, learning a simple 2-layer MLP for Question-Answer alignment (row 2) improves overall accuracy over our zero-shot baseline (row 1) by 21.84% but it's 24.58% worse compared to our N-way classification (row 3) baseline.

The comparison with our supervised upper-bound baseline shows that there is a lot of room for improvement for both of our approaches. In order to improve zero-shot VQA performance we need to improve our prompts and how we sample answers based on questions. Next, to improve our Question-Answer alignment model we can focus on improving our MLP model by using a better alignment network, better negative sampling strategy with loss appropriate re-weighting. These results establish a promising direction for a solution to VQA using CLIP.
