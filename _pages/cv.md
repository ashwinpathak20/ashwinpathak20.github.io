I am first year student at Georgia Tech studying MS CS with ML specialisation.

I have 2 years experience at Amazon in full-stack development. Skilled in Java, Python, C++. Strong media and communication professional with a Bachelor's degree focused in computer science and engineering from International Institute of Information Technology.

I have developed a keen interest in machine learning and its implications in business scenarios. Have worked on various problems ranging from NLP to CV problems.

* **Research Intern at ICAR-CNR** : May. 2019 - Jul. 2019 
   * Worked with Prof. Giuseppe Manco in Summer 2019 remotely. 
   * Worked on making the deep neural networks (DNN) secure using variational auto-encoders (VAE) as a technique and how to leverage this learning to make the DNNs more safe and secure.
* **Honors Reseacher in Computer Vision at IIITH** : Aug. 2017 - Jul. 2019 
   * Worked with Prof. P. J. Narayanan on user-perspective rendering for handheld device based Augmented Reality (AR) using neural networks.
   * Made the whole process highly optimized so that a mobile device can simultaneously capture live-feed from front camera, infer the facial features using neural network and then, render the augmented object in front screen by detecting the marker based on detected 3-D user movement.
* **Research Assistant at Precog** : Jan. 2019 - Apr. 2019
   * Worked with Prof. Ponnurangam Kumaraguru on Natural Language processing, where we generated a
     fine-grained multi-class dataset for hate-speech detection on GAB platform.
   * We (team of 4) employed a hybrid sub-word level CNN architecture with inferences drawn on alt-right nature of the hate-speech on GAB. The paper has been accepted at The 28th Intl. Conference on Computational Linguistics (https://coling2020.org/).
* **Research Assistant at IIITH** : Aug. 2018 - Nov. 2018
