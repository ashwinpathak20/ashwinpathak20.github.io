public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int buy0, buy1, sell0, sell1, sell2;
        int n = prices.size();
        if (n<2) {
            return 0;
        }
        buy0 = max(-prices[0], -prices[1]);
        buy1 = -prices[0];
        sell0 = max(0, buy1 + prices [1]);
        sell1 = sell0;
        sell2 = 0;
        buy1 = buy0;
        for(int i = 2; i<n; i++) {
            buy0 = max(buy1,  sell2 - prices[i]);
            sell0 = max(sell1, buy1 + prices[i]);
            sell2 = sell1;
            sell1 = sell0;
            buy1 = buy0;
        }
        return sell0;
    }
