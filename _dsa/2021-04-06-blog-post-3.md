# Question

- https://leetcode.com/problems/integer-break/

Given an integer n, break it into the sum of k positive integers, where k >= 2, and maximize the product of those integers.

Return the maximum product you can get.

# Approach

- Math


# Solution
```
class Solution {
public:
    int integerBreak(int n) {
        // n equals to 2 or 3 must be handled explicitly
        if (n == 2 || n == 3) return (n-1);
   
        // Keep removing parts of size 3 while n is greater than 4
        int res = 1;
        while (n > 4)
        {
            n -= 3;
            res *= 3; // Keep multiplying 3 to res
        }
        return (n * res); // The last part multiplied by previous parts
    }
};
```
