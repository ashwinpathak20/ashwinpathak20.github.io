This blog is dedicated to the first week of Google Summer of Code (i.e June 1 - June 7). The target of the first week according to my timeline was to get conversant with the code structure and implement the derivative using statsmodels and partly by numdifftools. 

* ### Status of Week 1 :
   I tried to stick to the plan. I have concentrated only on finite differences, complex methods are for latter part of the project. I have implemented the following :
   - #### Derivatives using statsmodels:
   
      I have implemented a vectorized code for derivatives using statsmodels along with docstrings and tests. It is present in scipy.diff.statsmodels._derivative.Derivaitve.
      
   - #### Gradient using statsdmodels:
      
      I have implemented a vectorized code for gradients using statsmodels along with docstrings and tests. It is present in scipy.diff.statsmodels._derivative.Gradient.
      
    - #### Jacobian using statsmodels:
    
      I have implemented a vectorized code for jacobians using statsmodels along with docstrings and tests. It is present in scipy.diff.statsmodels._derivative.Jacobian.
    
    - #### Derivatives using numdifftools:
    
      I was understanding the numdifftools and side by side trying to implement it. I have successfully implemented the code for derivatives, however, the code is not clean and needs modularization and refactoring. I will be doing this work in the second week.
      
* ### Updates:
  Link to the implemented code : [here](https://github.com/ashwinpathak20/scipy/tree/diff/scipy/diff)
  
* ### Next Target:
  Next week is dedicated to computation of derivatives, gradients and jacobian using finite differences from numdifftools.
