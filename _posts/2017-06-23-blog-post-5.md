This blog is dedicated to the second week of Google Summer of Code (i.e June 16 - June 23).
But first, a brief insight is given about how the code works.

## Step Generators
 
 For computing the derivatives, steps are required with which the apprxoimation is made.
 Each element in the step generators represent h in 
 ![numerical differentiation](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/240200932143283e051efead968a0bec0134e3a0).
 
 Choosing the steps are important for approximation. If the steps are very small,
 derivative becomes inaccurate due to rounding error caused by subtraction. While if steps are too large, 
 the results will be inaccurate due to the consideration of secant line.
 
 'max_steps' generates a decreasing sequence while 'min_steps' generates increasing sequence.
 
 ### Parameters
  - x : array, optional, default is np.asarray(1)
  
        The points at which steps are to be generated.
  - n : int, optional, default is 1
  
        order of derivative.
  - order : int, optional, default is 2
  
        defines the order of the error term in the Taylor approximation used.
  - method : {'central', 'forward', 'backward'}, optional, default: 'central'
  
        defines the method to be used.
  - base_step : float, array-like, optional
  
        Defines the start step.
        
        Default: 2 for max_step,
        
                 EPS**(1./scale) for min_step.
  - scale : real scalar, optional, default is 2.5
  
        scale used in base step.
  - num_steps : scalar integer, optional, default 15
  
        defines number of steps generated.
  - step_nom :  array-like, default maximum(log(1+|x|), 1)
  
        Nominal step is the same shape as x.
  - step_ratio : real scalar, optional, default 2
  
        Ratio between sequential steps generated.
        
        If None then step_ratio is 2 for n=1
        
        otherwise step_ratio is 1.6.
  - offset : real scalar, optional, default 0
  
        offset to the base step.
  - step : {'max_step', 'min_step'}, optional, defult 'max_step'
  
        Defines the nature of the steps to be generated, increasing or decreasing.
