The model trained on data size of 5714 and 36 classes didn't perform that good. I tried with approaches based on unlabeled data as well as fully labeled data, however, the accuracy still remained low. The graphs are attached as follows :

X-axis denotes number of epochs while y-axis denotes accuracy and loss respectively.

The architecture of the model is broadly :
