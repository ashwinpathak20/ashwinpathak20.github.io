The task of this week was to make a dataset for nazism element detection. I was provided with the positive examples, and I had to generate the negative ones. The initial given dataset consisted of around 2800 images in total belonging to various categories like :
 - 88_heil_hitler                  
 - nazi_eagle        
 - nazi_swastikas
 - blut_und_ehre                  
 -  nazi_flags       
 -  nazi_tattoo
 - crossed_grenade_emblem_nazism
 - nazi_parade       
 - schwarze_sonne
 - hitler_salute                   
 - nazi_party        
 - sieg_heil
 - meine_ehre_heisst_treue   
 - nazi_propaganda 
 - ss_death's_head
 - nazi_bolts                     
 -  nazi_rally       
 -  ss_iron_crosses

So, I generated the negative examples using [Google Images Download](https://github.com/hardikvasa/google-images-download/blob/master/README.rst) library. The negative examples that I generated were using keywords like :
- salute
- rally
- sun
- propaganda
- tattoo
- numbers
- swastikas
- eagle
- parade
- grenade
- etc :

I generated around 3000 images of the negative examples in total.

## Image Classification

The next task is to fine-tune a classification model. The model cannot be trained from scratch because of the deficiency of the number of images. So fine-tuning and transfer learning is the only option. This, for this purpose I used VGG16 per-trained model on ImageNet dataset. There are 5 blocks of convolutional layers in the model with each block consisting around 4 CNN layers. Fine-tuning works on the hypothesis that the initial layers preserve the coarse features while final layers are the one that learn the classifying features. So, I removed the last four layers and replaced 3 fully connected layers for classification. I divided the dataset into 80% for training, 10% for validation and 10% for training. I ran it for 32 epochs. The code for my implementation can be found out at :

The graphs for accuracy and loss are as follows :

with X-axis as the number of epochs. However, the classification task is not up to the mark, so I will be trying with removing more layers or increasing the number of epochs.
