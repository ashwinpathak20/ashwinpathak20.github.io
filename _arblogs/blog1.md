I have been selected for the GSOC 2017 under the umbrella organisation of Python Software Foundation - Scipy. The topic of my project is: implementation of a module : scipy.diff.

This project aims at implementing numerical derivative calculation methods which are a set of core scientific numerical tools that are currently missing in SciPy. There has been discussion (and general agreement) on creating a new scipy.diff sub-package starting with the numdifftools code and some code in statsmodels.

Please find a link to proposal for the same [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1WQwpD4VU3cewBH99a_2-3CcTmhtbclgS6JR1lVXmcYA/edit?usp=sharing).
