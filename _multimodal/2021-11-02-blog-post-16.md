In this blog, we will be exploring few-shot learning for summarization.

The first step is to list down the requirements and questions for which we are finding the answers :
- ???


## Few-Shot Learning of an Interleaved Text Summarization Model by Pretraining with Synthetic Data
- Paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.05131.pdf
- About the dataset used :
    - AMI dataset
    - PubMed dataset
- Model :
    - Hierarchical encoder-decoder architecture.
- Metrics :
    - ROUGE
- BaseLine Comparison
  - Transfer Learning
  - Human evaluation
- Learnings for our own proposed model :
    - Phrases in interleaved texts are equivalent to visual patterns in images, and therefore, attending phrases are more relevant for thread recognition than attending posts
    - Hence, hierarchical attention for phrases also is important.

## Few-Shot Learning for Opinion Summarization
- Paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/2004.14884.pdf
- About the dataset used:
    - Amazon dataset
    - Yelp dataset
- Model :
  - Encoder - Decoder architecture for unsupervised training
  - Novelty Reduction through regularization
  - Summary Adaptation
- Metrics :
  - ROUGE
- - BaseLine Comparison
  - Transfer Learning
  - Human evaluation
- Learnings for our own proposed model :
    - The summary generate by unsupervised learning is prone to producing
       a significant amount of information that is unsupported by reviews.
    - Also, since they are trained mostly on subjectively written reviews, and as a result, tend to generate summaries in the same writing style.

## Image-Grounded Conversations: Multimodal Context for Natural Question and Response Generation
- Paper : https://aclanthology.org/I17-1047.pdf
- About the paper :
    - Images based conversations
    - For Question Answering
    - Proposal of retrieval approaches
- About the ICG dataset :
    - Images : 4222
    - Utterances : 25332
- Process of data collection :
    - QA dialogues from VQG dataset.
    - Photo gallery selection from crowd-sourcing platform.
    - IGC-Twitter dataset consists of
        - 250K quadruples of visual context, textual context, question and response.
        - This dataset was further refined.
- Learnings for our own dataset :
    - ICG-Twitter dataset can be used for training
    - Also, the paper enlists the process of fetching conversation based data from twitter.
    - However, the ICG dataset is small, can prove to be good for testing.

## Towards Building Large Scale Multimodal Domain-Aware Conversation Systems
- Paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1704.00200.pdf
- About the dataset :
    - Dialogue : 150000
- Process of data collection :
    - Domain knowledge curation
        - Crawling
        - Parsing
        - Taxonomical filtering
        - Relevent fashion attributes identification
        - Creating fashion profile
    - Gathering multimodal dialogs :
        - Crowdsourcing
- Learnings for our own dataset :
    - A useful dataset with multiple images
    - Can be used for summarization
    - Lays out the details of data collection

## Situated Interactive MultiModal Conversations (SIMMC)
- This dataset is also along similar lines.

## Other important papers or dataset :
- RecipeQA: A Challenge Dataset for Multimodal Comprehension of Cooking Recipes
    - Paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.00812.pdf
- Ubuntu dialogue corpus
    - http://dataset.cs.mcgill.ca/ubuntu-corpus-1.0/
- Conversational AI datasets
    - https://www.topbots.com/conversational-ai-datasets/
- The Dialogue Dodecathlon
    - Paper : https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.03768.pdf

## What all different things can be incorporated to make this process of dataset generation simpler?
- As pointed out by some papers already creating our own dataset can be really laborious and demanding.
- In addition to these I believe twitter conversations are a very good place to start at.
- Filtering with images based posts can be really helpful.

## How to get the ground truth summaries?
- Getting ground truth summaries still does not have any shortcut method.
- Unsupervised learning to the rescue!
