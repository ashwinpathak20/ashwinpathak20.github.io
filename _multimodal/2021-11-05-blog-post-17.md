In this blog, we will be exploring unsupervised learning for multimodal conversation summarization.

Architecture 
- Encoder-Decoder Network
- Use encoder for modalities


Iterative Plan 
- Combined summary through disentanglement
- End-to-end summarization without disentanglement
- Increase modalities
