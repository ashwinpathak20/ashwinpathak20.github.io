# Contributions
- Presents a dataset of âˆ¼6k dialogs in which two humans with asymmetric information complete a 
  cooperative localization task in reconstructed 3D buildings.
- Define three challenging tasks: Localization from Embodied Dialog (LED),
  Embodied Visual Dialog, and Cooperative Localization.
- Focusing on LED, we present a strong baseline model with detailed ablations
  characterizing both modeling choices and dataset biases.
  
# Dataset
- Where Are You? (WAY)
- Built on Matterport3D


# Approach
- Localization   from   Embodied   Dialog.
    - Dialog Representation throw LSTMs and tokenization with GloVE (standard NLP technique)
    - Environment Representation throw ResNet18 CNN.
    - Pix2Pix LingUNet
- Embodied Visual Dialog
- Cooperative Localization.
