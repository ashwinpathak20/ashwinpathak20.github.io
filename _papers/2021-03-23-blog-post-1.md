# Overview
Synthesizing creative sketches using DoodlerGAN.
Compared to previous approaches 
that learn to mimic how humans draw,
the goal is to create sketches that
were not seen in human drawings. 

# Dataset
- Novel dataset : Creative Birds and Creative Creatures.
- Databased are collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk.
- The sketches are drawn by an initial random storke.
- An eye is asked to be drawn.
- Next, it is asked to draw each part of the creature by
  specifying the part being drawn.
- ~10k sketches for each category collected.

# Doodler GAN
- Part based sketch generation model.
- While ensuring at each step the appearance of the parts and
   partial sketches comes from corresponding distributions
   observed in human sketches. 
- Contains two modules -> part generator and part selector.
- Sketches are stored as raster images (i.e., grids of pixels)
  as opposed to vector representations
  of strokes. This makes detailed spatial information readily
  available, which helps the model better
  assess where a part connects with the rest of the sketch.  
- The input partial sketch is represented by stacking each part 
  as a channel, along with an additional
  channel for the entire partial sketch. 
  If a part has not been drawn, the corresponding channel is a zero
  image.

# Results
- Compared against : StyleGAN2 Unconditional, StyleGAN2 Conditional,
  SketchRNN Unconditional, SketchRNN Conditional, Percentage-based.
- Added quantitative and human evaluation.
